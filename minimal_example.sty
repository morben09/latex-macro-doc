%# This package serves as a minimal example for the creation of documentation for .sty-files.
%# To add plain text at an arbitrary position in this .pdf, use %# at the beginning of a line in the .sty-file.
%# The position of the %#-line in the .sty-file determines the position of that line in the final .pdf.
%#
%# Chapters are triggered by lines starting with %%% while sections are triggered by lines starting with %%.
%# To use comments along with the commands, use %-% directly after a line in which the command is defined.

%% This is a section triggered by a line starting with %%
